# soccer-app

## About
```
Sample front-end only app that shows list of soccer teams and allows the user to favorite teams.
The data fetched from json file and mocks it as server api (paging, sorting) - since no server for this sample.
The favorited teams are saved in indexedDb and kept for after refresh.
The list can be sorted by Name and Year Founded. (If there was server side, paging would be in db instead)
